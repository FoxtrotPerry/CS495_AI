Problem 12:

a) 

Personal Local Optima Log for Hill Climbing:

27023377358286572427835560143

b)

The slower cooling definitely helped in getting a higher score and better solution. My solution to
mutate my algorithm was to pick a random bit from the bit array that produced the best result so far and
flipping it to its opposite value and pushing that new array into a temporary array that could then
be evaluated. If the temporary array is better than the previously saved best solution then the temp
array overwrites the best solution.
